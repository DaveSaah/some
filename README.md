**`some`** is a tree-walking interpreter I am building to see, understand and
appreciate what happens when we run high-level programs.

There is no special reason for calling my interpreter `some`;
I choose it because I can :)

## Features (WIP)

- [ ] Simple syntax.
- [ ] Variable bindings.
- [ ] Data types: integers, booleans.
- [ ] Arithmetic expressions.
- [ ] Built-in functions (yet to be decided$^*$).
- [ ] First class functions.
- [ ] Recursion.
- [ ] Higher order functions.
- [ ] Closures.
- [ ] Collection data structures: strings, array, hash tables.
